This project is part of my data analysis and visualization portfolio. I used **Power BI** to transform and analyze survey data from data professionals, creating interactive visualizations that explore job roles, salaries, favorite programming languages, job satisfaction, and more.

## ⚙️ Project Process

### 1. 🧹 Dataset Preparation
- The file was pre-processed in Excel to correct date formats.
- Irrelevant columns were removed, and ambiguous responses were standardized.
- Specific transformations were applied to columns such as:
  - *Current Role*
  - *Industry*
  - *Country*
  - *Favorite Programming Language*
  - *Salary* (converted to average values from ranges)
